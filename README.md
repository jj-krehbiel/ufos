This repository uses JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js to create a dynamic table that can be filtered to display data that meets specified criteria. The repository contains an html page to display the table, a css style sheet, and a javascript page to handle multiple filters untilizing input fields and dropdown menus. The filters that can be applied are datetime, city, state, country, and shape. The javascript code also enables an alert box to pop up if a user inputs a filter that does not match any of the data table, alerting the user that there is no matching data.

Both the level 1 and 2 scripts will default to show all of the data when a user loads the page and when the user leaves the filter input fields blank.
